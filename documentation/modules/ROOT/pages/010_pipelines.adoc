== *Introducing Pipelines for Developers*

====
*What will you learn?*

This Module will explain the basics of the Tekton Pipeline functionality within OpenShift from a developer's perspective

The Module will walk you through creating tasks and pipelines, executing those tasks and pipelines within OpenShift, and how to add persistent storage between tasks.

It will also explain the theory behind Tasks and Pipelines to enable you to understand and exploit the concepts

After completing this Module you will understand the capabilities of Tekton and be able to create Tasks and Pipelines
====

=== *Pre-Requisites*

In order to undertake the Module you need to be logged onto the OpenShift cluster and have access to a Project. If you do not have rights to create a project, ask the Cluster administrators to provide one for you.

*Ensure the two textboxes at the top of this HTML Guide to the Module contain the Cluster address and the Project you will be using.* 

[NOTE]
====
A *Project* is an OpenShift object that contains all of your Applications and other components in a compartmented way. +
As the owner/user of a Project you have 'Admin' rights to it, meaning you can create any of the OpenShift objects that you have the rights to create within it.  
====

[WARNING]
====
*Please Read* - if you are using a *shared* project you may encounter issues with naming; this is because Objects within a *Project* must be _uniquely_ named. If someone
else is doing this course in the same Project they may have created objects with the names stated. +

*If you get an error when trying to create _anything_ as part of this module, add "__(your initials)" to the end of the Name attribute for the object
you are creating*
====

[WARNING]
====
This module requires that the Pipelines Operator has been installed on the CLuster you are using. If you have no 'Pipelines' navigation bar option then this hasn't been done; contact the
administrators for your cluster and check to see if the Operator has been added or not.
====

=== *An overview of the basics; Tasks and Pipelines*

Tekton provides a set of atomic components for creating extensive Pipeline functionality involving manipulating Objects within OpenShift.

That's the official Kubernetes definition, but let's take a step back and examine just what this functionality is actually for. 

=== What is a *Pipeline*?

In the old days writing software was a lot more of a chore. You had to write the software, work out how to compile it, link it, prepare it for production,
 physically move it, set it up, the works. There were many manual steps in getting the software from A to B and those steps always introduced points at which 
 mistakes could be made.

The concept of a Pipeline is simply a set of automated tasks that are executed in a prescribed order, with any of the tasks, if they fail, stopping the process. This technology was 
originally implemented in the *Hudson* and *Jenkins* products. In fact, OpenShift used *Jenkins* as its native pipeline technology in the previous release.

The issue with using *Jenkins* is that it was fire-and-forget; the container orchestration platform would start the Pipeline and then be informed at the end
as to whether or not the Pipeline had completed. Also, in order to interact with the platform, OpenShift had to provide an extended DSL to Jenkins, which made 
the provisioning of Pipelines a little bit of a black art.

The *Tekton* project extends the Kubernetes object model with components for the creation and execution of Pipelines _within the Cluster itself_. These Pipelines are executed as Containers (more on that in a moment)
and are controlled within the Cluster.

The *Pipelines* themselves are just a set of *Tasks* that are executed in a defined order. The *Task* is the atomic component of the Pipeline and it can be made up of one or more *steps*. Each *step* is in actuality a Container.

This is *very* powerful. Anything you can put in a Container can form a step of a task; in addition because the Cluster controls the execution of the steps and tasks it can influence and observe the Pipeline at all times.

In fact you can build Pipelines with logic based on the behaviour of the steps themselves; imagine being able to build an automated process for build, test, deploy that can change its own 
behaviour _in flight_ based on the results, or even the process consumption, of the steps within it.

This observability and fine grain control is what makes *Tekton* such a powerful tool.

[NOTE]
====
There are actually four basic primitives within the 'Pipeline' concept provided on *OpenShift* via Tekton. You have definition (cookie-cutter) objects for Task and Pipeline, which define
the behaviour of a task and the assembling of tasks for a pipeline, and then you have the temporal execution objects, *TaskRun* and *PipelineRun* which are actual runs of the objects; when you
execute a Pipeline the system creates a PipelineRun which contains the outputs for all the TaskRuns. These act as temporally stamped immutable objects which are used for audit and historical reference
====

=== Introducing *Tasks*

[TIP]
====
For this part of the module we will be interacting with the information panel pertaining to *Tasks*. 
====

Make sure you are at the *Topology* page of the UI. Choose *Search*, and then in the *Resources* pulldown type *Task*. Tick the search result for *(T) Task* and click on *Add to navigation* on the righthand side of the panel.

[NOTE]
====
This will add a shortcut on the lefthand navigation bar for getting to the *Tasks* panel. If the shortcut does not immediately appear, refresh your browser page.
====

Now click on *Tasks* in the lefthand navigation panel.

image::010-image002.png[Tasks Panel,width=550px]

We are going to create the simplist of tasks; all of the examples we are going to use are simple just to show the mechanics of the Pipelines. In actuality when using Pipelines
in production and devops the tasks will be entities such as 'Clone a Git Repo', 'Compile the code', 'Perform code analysis'.

[NOTE]
====
*OpenShift* Pipelines ships with a set of archetypal tasks that can be easily combined into powerful Pipelines. If you perform a search, as you did to find *Tasks*, but in this case search
for *ClusterTask* you can examine the ones that are installed in the Cluster. When you build Pipelines you can use these; also note that these tasks normally come with
a number of parameters you have to provide, such as the Git repo for the *Clone Git* task. +

Using the ClusterTask panel you can examine these. Shown below is an extract of the params component of the Git Clone task. 
====

image::010-image003.png[Git Clone Task,width=550px]

We are going to create a very simple task that has two steps. Click on *Tasks*. Click on *Create Task* in the top right of the panel.

Delete the contents of the YAML editor and replace it with this:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: ctask1
spec:
  steps:
    - name: id
      image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
      command:
        - cat
      args:
        - /etc/redhat-release
    - name: echo
      image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
      command:
        - echo
      args:
        - "In task 1"
----

Hit *Create*. The system will create the task and take you to the *Task* overview page.

[TIP]
====
What we have done is create a cookie-cutter for creating a task. The task consists of two steps; the first step uses the latest UBI8 (RHEL8 Universal Base Image), is called *id* and
simply calls the *cat* command with the parameters */etc/redhat-release*. The second step, called *echo*, calls the command *echo* with the parameter *"In task1"*, again using the
latest RHEL8 UBI.

In actuality you have as many steps using as many different images as you like. This example is a simple atomic unit that executes two Containers in series with the appropriate commands
====

Again, as we said, this is a template for executing the task so we haven't executed anything, just provided the rules.

To test the task we will create a simple pipeline using the UI. *Pipelines* is already an element in the lefthand menu, so click on *Pipelines*.

Click on *Create Pipeline*. This will take you to the *Pipeline builder* page. Note that you can either create a pipeline using the graphical tools or, as with any object 
in OpenShift, simply give it the YAML. In this case we will use the graphical interface to quickly create a single task pipeline using the task we just created.

Change the *Name* to *example-pipeline1*.

Click on *Add Task*. In the pop-up box type *ctask1* (the name of the task we just created). The system will show the task; click on *Add*. Leave everything else
as it is and hit *Create*.

image::010-image004.png[Created pipeline,width=600px]

Again, as with the Task, we have created a template for running this Pipeline. The Pipeline consists of one task, which has two steps. Pull down the *Actions* pulldown and hit *Start*.

The pipeline will now execute. Note the icon shows *two* distinct steps within the task. When the pipeline completes there will be a green arrow next to the Task (with multiple tasks this gives a clear indication of success or failure for each task). If you now
click directly on the Pipeline icon it will display a list of Tasks (in this case, just the one) with the logs from that task (as shown below).

image::010-image005.png[Successful log of task,width=600px]

=== Combining Multiple Tasks in a Pipeline

For this part of the exercise we are going to create two additional tasks. Click on *Tasks* in the lefthand panel and using *Create Task* add the two following tasks:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: ctask2
spec:
  steps:
    - name: id
      image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
      command:
        - cat
      args:
        - /etc/redhat-release
    - name: echo
      image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
      command:
        - echo
      args:
        - "In task 2"
----

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: ctask3
spec:
  steps:
    - name: id
      image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi:latest
      command:
        - cat
      args:
        - /etc/redhat-release
    - name: echo
      image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi:latest
      command:
        - echo
      args:
        - "In task 3"
----

We will now create a Pipeline, but instead of using the *builder* we will do it via YAML. Click on *Pipelines* on the lefthand panel, then *Create Pipeline*. Switch to *YAML* view and replace the text in the *YAML* editor with:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: cpipeline1
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: task1
      taskRef:
        kind: Task
        name: ctask1
    - name: task2
      taskRef:
        kind: Task
        name: ctask2
    - name: task3
      taskRef:
        kind: Task
        name: ctask3
      runAfter:
        - task1
----

Click *Save* and then execute the Pipeline using the *Actions* then *Start*.

[TIP]
====
The syntax within a Pipeline definition is very simple; you define the set of tasks simply by providing them with a name, within the Pipeline, and a reference
to a preloaded task name. In this case our tasks are called ctaskx, and the tasks in the Pipeline are called taskx. Also the Pipeline allows for order definition. +

In this case we have said run task1 and task2 independently and then run task3 after task1 has completed. +

Also note that the task3 uses a later (RHEL9) version of the base image. Check the logs to see what it reports as its version.
====

image::010-image006.png[Successful run,width=600px]

By abstracting the atomic task behaviour into separate tasks and then having the *Pipeline* control the ordering of the tasks there is a nice distinction between the functionality. However the tasks are physically different and behave 
like individual, transient containers. Persistence of information between tasks is done using *Workspaces* which provide, again, an abstracted
approach to Pipeline technology.

=== Persisting data between Tasks 

We are going to create another pithy example here - in this case we are going to create three tasks, the first of which creates a file, the second checks it exists and the third deletes it.

If we were just using Tasks the second task would fail; when the first task completes the Container is removed and all changes it made to the Container image would be lost. 

[NOTE]
====
This isn't the case when you use *steps* that are the same Image; for efficiency a Task will reuse the file system of an Image across steps.
====

For this example we will create three new tasks. Using the *Tasks* menu item on the lefthand panel, *Create Task*, replace the YAML and create each of the following:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: ubifilecreate
spec:
  steps:
    - name: id
      image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
      command:
        - cat
      args:
        - /etc/redhat-release
    - name: echo
      image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
      command:
        - echo
      args:
        - "Creating the file in the workspace"
    - name: createfile
      image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
      command:
        - touch
      args:
        - "/ocpintro/test.txt"
  workspaces:
    - name: working
      mountPath: /ocpintro
----

[TIP]
====
Note the addition of a *workspaces* component. This maps an externally defined piece of storage, named *working*, to the path */ocpintro* in the containers for *all* steps.
====

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: ubifilecheck
spec:
  steps:
    - name: id
      image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
      command:
        - cat
      args:
        - /etc/redhat-release
    - name: echo
      image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
      command:
        - echo
      args:
        - "Checking the file has been created in the workspace"
    - name: checkfile
      image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
      script: |
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        ls -alZ /ocpintro/test.txt
  workspaces:
    - name: working
      mountPath: /ocpintro
----

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: ubifileremove
spec:
  steps:
    - name: id
      image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
      command:
        - cat
      args:
        - /etc/redhat-release
    - name: echo
      image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
      command:
        - echo
      args:
        - "Removing the file from the workspace"
    - name: removefile
      image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
      script: |
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        rm /ocpintro/test.txt
  workspaces:
    - name: working
      mountPath: /ocpintro
----

Now we have three new tasks we can create a Pipeline to use them. Click on *Pipelines* on the lefthand panel. Click on *Create Pipeline*. Switch to *YAML view* if it isn't already on there. Replace the code with the following:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: ubifilepipeline
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: create
      taskRef:
        kind: task
        name: ubifilecreate
      workspaces:
        - name: working
          workspace: workingworkspace
    - name: check
      taskRef:
        kind: task
        name: ubifilecheck
      runAfter:
        - create
      workspaces:
        - name: working
          workspace: workingworkspace
    - name: remove 
      taskRef:
        kind: task
        name: ubifileremove
      runAfter:
        - check
      workspaces:
        - name: working
          workspace: workingworkspace
  workspaces:
    - name: workingworkspace
----

[TIP]
====
Note that we provide a *workspace* to every task defined in the Pipeline (by creating an abstract workspace, called *workingworkspace*, and attaching it by name to the tasks using
the name we used in the *Task* definition.
====

Hit *Create*.

image::010-image007.png[File Pipeline,with=600px]

Now in order to run the Pipeline with persisted storage we need to create some for it. Switch to the *Administrator* viewpoint, click on *Storage*, click on *PersistentVolumeClaims* then *Create PersistentVolumeClaim*.

Set the *PersistentVolumeClaim name* to *pipeline-pvc*. Set the *Size* to *1 GB*. Hit *Create*.

Switch back to the *Developer* viewpoint. Click on *Pipelines*. Click on *(PL) ubifilepipeline*. Pulldown the *Actions* pulldown and select *Start*.

[TIP]
====
The Pipeline defines that it needs a workspace but the definition we provided didn't state what it was. The OpenShift UI automatically prompts you to choose how you will
provide the workspace. We have created a PVC to provide persisted storage
====

Click on the pulldown for the *workingworkspace* workspace. Select *PersistentVolumeClaim*. A *PVC* pulldown will appear; click on this and it should list the 
PVC we just created. Click on that to select it. Hit *Start*.

[TIP]
====
The Pipeline should progress through successfully. Have a look at the logs and make sure each has performed correctly; each task has three steps, firstly to inform what version of RHEL the container is, secondly to echo the stage name, and thirdly to perform the action. +

The tasks will create, check and delete a file on the shared storage
====

image::010-image008.png[Pipeline PVC,width=600px]

=== Cleaning up

[TIP]
====
When you create Objects in OpenShift they will remain resident until you remove them
====

To finish the Module head to the *Topology page*, go to the *Pipelines* panel and delete all the Pipelines there. Then go to the *Tasks* panel and remove the tasks you created.
