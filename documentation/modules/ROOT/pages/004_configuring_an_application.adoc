== *Configuring an OpenShift Application*

====
*What will you learn?*

This module will introduce you to the configuration options for the Applications running within OpenShift

This will highlight the components you can change and their effect

After completing the Module you will be able set various behaviours of the Application running in OpenShift, from the perspective of the way in which the Application is hosted
====

=== *Pre-Requisites*

In order to undertake the Module you need to be logged onto the D2S cluster and have access to a Project. This Project is pre-created for you by the D2S Admins.

*Ensure the two textboxes at the top of this HTML Guide to the Module contain the D2S Cluster address and the Project you have been assigned.* If not use the 'Copy' button on the text below to get the Cluster address and add it to the Cluster textbox above (pressing *RETURN* after pasting it). Then add the Project name if it is not already there, again pressing *RETURN* after entering it into the field.

[WARNING]
====
*Please Read* - if you are using a *shared* project you may encounter issues with naming; this is because Objects within a *Project* must be _uniquely_ named. If someone
else is doing this course in the same Project they may have created objects with the names stated. +

*If you get an error when trying to create _anything_ as part of this module, add "__(your initials)" to the end of the Name attribute for the object
you are creating*
====

=== *Setting up the Application for the Module*

This Module will explain the mechanics of configuring an Application's behaviour while running in OpenShift.

[NOTE]
====
This Module is all about crafting the way in which the Application operates within OpenShift itself. OpenShift hosts the Application as a Pod containing one (or more)
running Containers; in this Module we will adjust the way in which OpenShift hosts the Application, not the actual Application behaviour. In Module 006 we will examine the ways
in which additional information can be provided to a running Application to effect the way in which it operates (using Config Maps and Environment Variables).
====

For the sake of simplicty we will use a similar Application to the one we used in previous Modules.

In the D2S UI make sure you are logged on, as stated in the pre-requisites and in the Project provided. Switch the UI to the Developer viewpoint using the selector in the top left.

Select *+Add* from the left-hand menu.

Click on *Container Images*. 

Leave the selection of Image on *Image name from external registry*. Copy (or type) the following address into the textbox:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
quay.io/ilawson/devex4
----

Click on the pulldown for the *Application* and select *Create Application*. In the *Application Name* textbox enter config-app. Set the *Name* to configexample.

In *Resources* set the resource type to *DeploymentConfig*. Hit *Create* to start the Application creation and deployment.

[NOTE]
====
As this is a create from Image it should setup the example application quickly. No build will be executed and the Topology page should appear with the application displayed as below.
====

=== *Examining the Deployment Configuration for the Application*

Click on the roundel for the Application. The panel that appears on the right of the Topology page will display the Deployment Configuration for the Application.

[NOTE]
====
OpenShift uses two Objects for defining how an Application is deployed; a *Deployment*, which is the standard Kubernetes definition of a deployment (Image location and replicas), or a *DeploymentConfig*, which is the extended OpenShift object. +

In this Module we will be examining and editing the DeploymentConfig created as part of the Application deployment. +

The panel that appears will have an icon with the letters *DC* on it at the title of the tab. These icons are shortcuts for the type of Object being displayed.
====

image::004-image003.png[DC sidepanel]

Click on the *Details* tab. This will switch the right-hand panel to show more information about the way in which the Application is deployed

=== *Scaling the Application up and down*

In the Details tab you will see another Roundel; this one indicates the number of active replicas for the application. 

[NOTE]
====
Kubernetes and OpenShift have a concept called 'ReplicationControllers' which are tasked with making sure that the
required number of replicas of an Application are running at all times. These replicas are exact copies of the Application from the Image (with
separate Pods/file systems). +

As with all Kubernetes objects these replicas __reconcile__ physically. They exist on the Worker nodes, which communicate back to the
control plane of OpenShift through the __Kubelet__. If a replica fails or, for example, a Worker Node goes offline, the ReplicationController
instantly detects that the required number of replicas is not physically active, and will recreate the replica somewhere within the Cluster.
====

image::004-image004.png[The Scaling Roundel,width=300px]

Now we will scale our Application up to four replicas. Do this by clicking on the Up arrow next to the Roundel until the replica count in the Roundel indicates four copies. Watch the behaviour of the Roundel as you do this.

[TIP]
====
The Roundel will divide into four effective quadrants, one for each of the replicas. As each of the replicas is started the quadrant will change from light blue (starting) to
dark blue (active).
====

If you now click on the *Resources* tab. Note that the Pods panel now displays that there are four active pods (three displayed).

Click on the *View all 4* link. The content page will change to list all the active Pods for this Application.

image::004-image005.png[List of Pods for the Application Deployment]

Click on *Topology* again. On the right-hand panel click on *Details* again. Using the Down arrow next to the Roundel set the number of replicas to zero. Watch the Roundel switch to a blank empty one as the system removes all the copies.

=== *Changing the Deployment Strategy*

One of the nice features about using the OpenShift *DeploymentConfig* is that it supports two distinct and different Deployment Strategies.

These reflect two distinct world usecases; zero downtime upgrade and security specific upgrades.

==== *Zero Downtime Upgrade*

A real world example; you have an Application that you have spent a good deal of time writing. When it is deployed you notice that the HTML Title has a spelling mistake in it. This is a cosmetic error and the Application is being used in anger by a number of people. In the old days this
would require taking the Application offline, fixing the error, then redeploying. With OpenShift we support a Deployment Strategy called *Rolling* which allows you to roll out an application
in a staged way so as not to interrupt use of the Application.

To make this easier to visualise we are going to change the options on the topology to be able to see the state of the Application better. Switch to the Topology view. Under the Project name in the top left of the Topology
panel there is a pulldown marked *Display options*. Click on this and then under *Show* click on *Pod count*. This will change the viewpoint to display the number of active Pods and their states in the centre of the Roundel on the Topology
tab. It should state 'Scaled to 0'.

We will now demonstrate this - scale the Application up to *3* replicas using the Up arrow next to the empty Roundel in the right hand information panel, within the *Resources* tab. Wait until the three replicas are all running correctly (the Roundel will be dark blue).

image::004-image006.png[Scaling to three replicas,width=300px,height=200px]

Underneath the Roundel you will see an indicator that the Deployment has an update strategy of *Rolling*. What we are going to do is perform a Rollout.

[TIP]
====
Starting a Rollout forces the ReplicationController to redeploy the active replicas. We will see the different ways in which the rollout is applied depending on the Strategy chosen.
====
 
In the right-hand panel for the *DeploymentConfig* you should see an indicator that this rollout is at version 1 (under the *Latest version* label). Select the *Actions* pulldown and 
choose *Start Rollout*. Carefully watch the Roundels in the right-hand panel.

image::004-image008.png[Rolling rollout]

[TIP]
====
What you are seeing is as follows; the left-hand Roundel indicates the state of the previous rollout, the right-hand Roundel displays the new Rollout. +

The ReplicationController starts by spinning up one copy of the new Rollout - this could be a change to the code, a change to the DeploymentConfig, a change to the environment variables etc. When the single instance of the new deployment
has started correctly (the Roundel will go dark blue), the ReplicationController *removes* one of the old Pods. +

At *all* points the count of active Pods, a mix of new and old, equals or just exceeds the required number of replicas. +

The ReplicationController then proceeds to startup the new Pods, one by one, performing the same 'startup, teardown' approach with the old Pods until no old Pods
exist +

This gives the *zero downtime* functionality
====

Now choose *Actions* and then *Edit DeploymentConfig*.

In the *Deployment Strategy* section change the *Strategy type* to *Recreate* (as shown below)

image::004-image007.png[Choosing the Recreate strategy,width=400px]

Click *Save*. The UI will shift back to the topology page. Pull down the Actions menu again and click *Start rollout*. Watch carefully the Roundels in the right-hand information panel.

image::004-image009.png[Recreate rollout]

[TIP]
====
What you are now seeing is the 'security shutdown' approach to Applications; the real world example of this is that you have found an exploit in the Application and need to patch it fast, and when you start the
patch there must be *no* running copies of the previous version. +

The *Recreate* strategy removes __all__ the running instances of the Application before starting to rollout the new copies.
====

=== Cleaning up

[TIP]
====
When you create Applications in OpenShift they will remain resident until you remove them
====

To finish the Module head to the *Topology page*, click on each of the *Application Groups* (i.e. (A) config-app) and in the *Actions* menu on the righthand panel for the Application choose *Delete Application*.
The system will prompt you to enter the name of the Application Group; enter this name and press return/hit *Delete*.

[TIP]
====
Deleting the Application Group removes all of the Objects relating to the application
